# whenever a obj is created , what happens behind the scene is a constructor is called Default constructor .
# Constructor -> Invoked during obj creation -> No return type -> No i/p parameter
# Whenever for example i create a obj that is - Hero ramesh; -> It automatically creates - ramesh.Hero(); 
# ramesh.Hero(); -> It means - Ramesh is obj - Ramesh's Hero function is called which is created automatically created when we create a class.
# Dynamically const called -> Hero *h = new Hero; ------ Statically called -> Hero Ramesh;
